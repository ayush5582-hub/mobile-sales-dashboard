I developed a Power BI dashboard to monitor mobile phone sales with dynamic interactivity. It features filters for brand, model, payment method, and month, and displays key metrics like total sales, number of transactions, average price, and total units sold. I used DAX functions such as CALCULATE, COUNTROWS, SUMX, and SUM to build these calculations and apply context-specific filters. The dashboard also includes visuals like geospatial sales maps, monthly trend lines, payment method breakdowns, rating distributions, and model/weekday comparisons. It connects to your dataset, refreshes seamlessly, and supports exploratory insight into sales performance.
