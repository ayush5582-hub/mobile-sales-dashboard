I developed a Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze mobile phone sales across multiple dimensions. With interactive filters for brand, model, payment method, and month, it showcases key KPIs like total sales, transaction count, average price, and units sold. The visuals include sales mapped by city, monthly trends, payment‐method breakdowns, rating distributions, and model/weekday comparisons. The dashboard connects to your data source (CSV, SQL, etc.), refreshes data dynamically, and allows users to explore insights with ease. It’s ideal for spotting patterns, comparing product performance, and guiding strategic decisions.
